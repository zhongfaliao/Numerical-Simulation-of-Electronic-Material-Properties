# Numerical-simulation-of-electronic-material-properties

This is a big project that involves reproducing many numerical models in the academia

### Purpose

Simulate the changes of electronic and optical properties of the materials under the influences of doping, carrier injection and bias

### Methods: Numerical integration, finite difference
